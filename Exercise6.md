# Exercise 6 - Debugging a RTOS Application using JTAG and GDB

The goal of this exercise is to make use of JTAG as a remote debugging tool. So in this exercise we are going to create a simple application and then use JTAG as to debug and analyse that application. To perform this exercise you are going to need the following:

* [LPCXpresso55S69 Development Board](https://www.nxp.com/design/development-boards/lpcxpresso-boards/lpcxpresso55s69-development-board:LPC55S69-EVK).
* [The Segger J-Link Adapter](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/j-link-edu/).
* [A Cortex JTAG Connector](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/accessories/adapters/9-pin-cortex-m-adapter/).

You will also need to download and install the [J-Link](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/) software on your laptop.
